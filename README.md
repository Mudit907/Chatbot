**Simple Python Chatbot**

This repository contains a basic chatbot implemented in Python. It's a foundational project designed to demonstrate simple conversational AI using keyword matching and predefined responses.

**Features**

Rule-Based Responses: The chatbot responds to user input based on a set of predefined rules and keywords.
Basic Interaction: It can handle simple greetings, farewells, and answer a few hardcoded questions.
Extensible: The core logic is straightforward, making it easy to add more rules and expand its conversational capabilities.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mudit907/Chatbot.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Chatbot

Usage

To run the chatbot, simply execute the chatbot.py (or similar main file name if different) script:
python chatbot.py

Once running, you can type your messages into the console, and the chatbot will respond.

**How It Works (Conceptual)**

The chatbot operates on a set of if-elif-else conditions. It checks user input against predefined keywords or phrases. If a match is found, it returns a corresponding hardcoded response. If no specific match is found, it provides a default "I don't understand" type of message.

**Future Enhancements**

More Sophisticated Pattern Matching: Implement regular expressions or NLTK for more advanced text analysis.
Memory/Context: Add the ability for the chatbot to remember previous parts of the conversation.
External Data Sources: Integrate with APIs or databases to provide more dynamic and informative responses.
Machine Learning Integration: Explore using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for more intelligent responses and learning capabilities.
